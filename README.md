__*Project Description:*__

The purpose of this project was to create a better understand in working with CSV, JSON, and XML files so when working with future projects I understand the file types I am working with.

I wanted to use the same data set with all three file types so that I could better visualize the data.

I began the project by working with CSV files or Comma Separated Values. This is a form of text file that's values are separated by commas to create a row.

Here is an example of my [CSV File:](CSV_Practive.csv)

When you click on the link you see that it will actually be turned into a table - if you click on "RAW" you will see the CSV script.

JSON files stores data in a hierarchical with the use of commas, curly brackets and normal brackets. This data formatting creates a trees which, makes it easy to see the relationship between the data being analyzed.

Here is an example of my [JSON File:](JSON_Practice.json)

Here is a visual of that JSON tree:
